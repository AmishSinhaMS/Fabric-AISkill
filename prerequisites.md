> [!IMPORTANT]
> AI Skill is not available on trial capacities  even though they are F64 equivalent.  The same is true for Copilot

> [!TIP]
> Consider creating a new workspace (`ws_aiskill`) and new Lakehouse in that workspace called `lh_aiskill`.

If you do not have any of the prerequisites, work with your instructor to set them up.
