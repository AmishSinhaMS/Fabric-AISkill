## Introduction

> [AI Skill is] a new capability in Fabric that allows you to build your own generative AI experiences. We believe that generative AI enables a fundamentally new way for you to interact with your data, dramatically increasing the amount of data-driven decision-making in organizations across the world. After months of testing, weâ€™re excited to put this tool in the hands of all Fabric customers.[^1]

> [!NOTE]
> AI Skill is currently in Public Preview.

### AI Skill Features
- Write natural language questions about your data to AI Skill and it will write SQL and run it for you, returning the answer.
- Publish the AI Skill as an endpoint for consumption by other sources, eg custom Copilots
